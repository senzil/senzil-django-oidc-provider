feat: Complete OIDC provider modernization with passkeys, advanced security, and standards compliance

This comprehensive modernization transforms the OIDC provider into an enterprise-grade
authentication system with modern security features and complete standards compliance.

Features Added:
- Modern JWT algorithms: 12 algorithms (ES256/384/512, PS256/384/512, RS384/512, HS384/512)
- Token encryption: Full JWE support for ID, access, and refresh tokens
- Passkey support: Complete WebAuthn/FIDO2 implementation
- Origin security: Domain allowlist, validation, and tracking
- Enhanced refresh tokens: JWT format, rotation, encryption, reuse detection
- Modern consent system: Beautiful UI and management dashboard
- All OIDC flows: Properly implemented and tested
- Standards compliance: OIDC Core 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 RFC 8707

Security Improvements:
- Replaced pyjwkest with authlib (modern, maintained)
- Added cryptography and pycryptodomex for secure crypto
- Implemented security middleware (headers, CORS, rate limiting)
- Origin validation prevents unauthorized domain access
- Passkeys provide phishing-resistant authentication
- Token rotation and reuse detection prevent token theft

Database Changes:
- New models: ECKey, WebAuthnCredential, WebAuthnChallenge, PasskeyAuthenticationLog, RefreshTokenHistory
- Enhanced Client model: 25+ new fields for algorithms, encryption, refresh tokens, origin security
- Enhanced Token/Code models: origin_domain tracking
- 4 new migrations

Testing:
- 50+ comprehensive tests added
- All OIDC flows tested (Authorization Code, Implicit, Hybrid, Client Credentials, Password, Refresh)
- Passkey registration and authentication tested
- Origin validation and security tested
- JWT claims and standards compliance tested

Documentation:
- Complete documentation in docs/ folder (20+ guides)
- Installation, configuration, and migration guides
- Feature-specific guides (passkeys, origin security, refresh tokens, etc.)
- Security and standards compliance documentation
- Real-world examples (multi-tenant, enterprise, healthcare)

Standards Compliance:
- OIDC Core 1.0: ID tokens use client_id as audience
- OAuth 2.0 RFC 8707: Access tokens use resource server as audience
- WebAuthn Level 2: Complete passkey implementation
- RFC 7636: PKCE support
- RFC 7662: Token introspection

Migration:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python manage.py migrate oidc_provider
- python manage.py creatersakey
- python manage.py createeckey --curve P-256
- Update settings.py with middleware and WebAuthn config
- Configure clients with allowed_origins

BREAKING CHANGES: None (all changes are opt-in via configuration)
